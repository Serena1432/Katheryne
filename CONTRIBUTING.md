# Contributing to Katheryne

First off, thanks for your interest in contributing to Katheryne! This is a personal project made public for educational and collaborative purposes.

## 💡 Project philosophy

Katheryne is designed as a **private-use remote control tool for Linux-based gaming systems**. It is **not** intended to be a commercial, public-facing, or production-grade solution. Contributions should align with this goal: simplicity, transparency, and practical value for trusted small-group environments.

## 🛠️ What you can contribute

Here are a few areas where help is welcome:

- 🐞 **Bug fixes** — especially for compatibility across distros or hardware (e.g., AMD, Wayland)
- 🧠 **Feature improvements** — within the scope of private/remote session control
- 🧹 **Code cleanup and refactoring**
- 🧾 **Documentation** — improve clarity or correct inaccuracies in the README or config files
- 🧪 **Testing** — provide feedback or patches for hardware Katheryne doesn’t officially support

## 🚫 What’s *not* accepted (for now)

To keep the project aligned with its intended use case:

- ❌ Public server support (scalability/security layers)
- ❌ Windows/macOS support
- ❌ GUI configuration tools (Katheryne is CLI/Discord-driven by design)
- ❌ Dependency-heavy frameworks or major architecture overhauls

If you're unsure whether a contribution fits, feel free to open an issue or discussion first.

## 🧾 How to contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-name
```

2. **Write clear, atomic commits** and include comments where needed.

3. **Test your changes** on a Linux system.

4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear title and description. If possible, reference related issues or explain your use case.

5. Wait for review. I’ll do my best to provide feedback promptly.

## 🙏 Thanks

Even if your contribution isn’t merged, your ideas, testing, and suggestions are still valuable. Feel free to fork or adapt Katheryne to your own needs.

Happy hacking!
