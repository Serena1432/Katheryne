# Katheryne

**Katheryne** is a work-in-progress Discord BOT designed for remote gameplay, computer management, and connectivity via Discord.

Currently, it only supports Linux and Windows, which the latter is still in the early stage.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This BOT prioritizes simplicity and convenience over security and is intended for personal or small-scale use (e.g., providing a "cloud computer" for friends or remotely managing your own device). **It is not suitable for large public servers, as I cannot guarantee security at scale.**

Only grant permissions to trusted individuals. **USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK. I am not responsible for any damage resulting from its use.**

## üéØ Purpose

I originally created this BOT in 2023 to let my friends easily connect to my computer and use features remotely without relying on traditional remote control applications. It also allows me to manage my own computer while away.

The initial implementation worked well, but I lost the original code recently. To prevent this from happening again, I decided to rebuild it and make it open-source.

In October 2025, I began to let my friend play in Windows because of instability (and restrictions) in Linux (because most of their games are Windows-exclusive). Therefore, I decided to port Katheryne into Windows (one more time).

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Who is this for?

Katheryne is intended for **power users** who want to remotely manage or share a gaming PC via Discord - with full control over sessions, user isolation, and system behavior.

It's best suited for:

- Self-hosters running a shared or personal "cloud gaming" setup
- Users comfortable with command-line configuration
- Developers or tinkerers interested in Discord-based automation

This project is **not recommended** for casual users, public servers, or non-Linux systems. This is a personal tool made open-source for learning and experimentation.

## üíª Support

* Katheryne works best with **KDE Plasma 6 on Linux** but is compatible with any distribution using X11 or Wayland.

* **Windows support is still in a very early stage**. Features are not guaranteed to work flawlessly, and bugs/glitches may happen anytime. However, most of the basic features still work as if it's running on Linux.

Intel CPUs + NVIDIA GPUs are also recommended. I haven't tested AMD CPUs/GPUs, so be prepared for potential issues.

### Supported Remote Play Applications

Currently, I only write some supporting features for **Steam Link / Remote Play**.

Moonlight and other tools can be launched via remote execution but are **not officially supported**, so you have to run the commands manually.

### Will there be support for macOS?

No chance. macOS is clearly not designed for gaming, and playing Windows games on macOS is absolutely a nightmare.

## ‚ú® Features

These features can be used directly in a Discord server, provided you have the required permissions.

Most of the features work best on Linux.

- [X] Run whitelisted applications remotely using commands/built-in integrations
- [X] Take screenshots and monitor system stats
- [X] Auto-send in-game screenshots to a Discord channel
- [X] Lock the physical keyboard/mouse to prevent interference (I made that as my kids usually interrupt gameplay when my friends are playing)
- [X] Turn off the physical display and mute audio (for the same reason as above)
- [X] Send notifications (on-screen messages) to the computer from Discord
- [X] Refocus the game window if it minimizes unexpectedly
- [X] Remotely shut down the computer (only if the owner is away or explicitly allows it)
- [X] Remotely execute any commands on the computer (for BOT owner only)
- [X] Notify when the computer isn't plugged in, the battery is low, temperature is high or a driver error, requiring physical intervention
- [X] Check the connection between the user and computer through Steam Remote Play (experimental, may not work on some devices)
- [X] [LocalStorage/Config folder separation support for each user](#localstorageconfig-data-separation-support)
- [X] [Assigning different Steam account for each Discord user](#assigning-a-different-steam-account-for-each-user)

> [!NOTE]
> Any changes with computer settings (physical input lock, brightness, volume, etc.) will be back to normal after restarting the computer. So if you encounter any errors when using the BOT, you just need to restart the computer.

### Platform commands coverage

#### By operating systems

| Feature | Linux (X11) | Linux (Wayland) | Windows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Take screenshots | ‚úÖ | ‚≠ï | ‚úÖ (1) |
| View computer stats | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ (2) |
| Lock/disable physical input | ‚úÖ | üî¥ | X |
| Change screen brightness | üî¥ | üî¥ | ‚úÖ (3) |
| Mute the host audio | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Refocus the game window | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Remotely shutdown the computer | üî¥ | üî¥ | ‚úÖ |
| Set the fan speed | ‚ùì | ‚ùì |
| Set the CPU governor | üî¥ | üî¥ | ‚ùå |
| Check the running process | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

* (1) May experience cropping issues if display size is set to over than 100% (e.g. 125% or 150%).
* (2) Viewing Intel GPUs' statistics isn't supported yet.
* (3) It's impossible (for me) to turn off the display completely on Windows. I'm using `nircmd` to handle the display toggle, but the display will be automatically on when moving the mouse or pressing a key.

> [!TIP]
> On Windows, running the BOT with administrator permissions is **recommended, but not required**.

‚úÖ Fully supported without root permissions<br>
üî¥ Supported but requires root permissions<br>
‚≠ï Supported but not tested<br>
‚ùå Totally not supported

Currently, AMD CPUs/GPUs are not properly supported as I don't have any AMD computers.

*To protect privacy, some features will only be available when a **whitelisted game/application is running**.*

### Running root commands (Linux)

To run commands that require root permissions, you can do one of these ways below:

* Grant the permissions for specific commands used by the BOT (recommended)
* Running the BOT with `sudo` permissions
    * Using this way may cause some unexpected errors, proceed at your own risk.
    * Steam and some games will have some glitches, and tends to have a higher ping when Katheryne is running as root (idk why but it's what it is)
* Or don't use these commands at all

#### List of root commands (Linux)

This is the list of commands requiring root permissions:

* **Intel GPU stats:**<br>`intel_gpu_top`
* **Set display brightness:**<br>`brightnessctl set ${pc}%`
* **Set CPU governor:**<br>`echo "${governor}" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor`
* **Set fan speed:**<br>`nbfc set -s ${pc}`
* **Physical input locking (Wayland):**<br>`evtest --grab /dev/input/event${id} >/dev/null`
* **Physical input device listing (Wayland):**<br>`libinput list-devices`

For security reasons, you have to find a way to allow these commands for your user by yourself.

## üì¶ Required applications

## üöÄ Usage

### üß∞ Installation

* Clone this BOT using this command below or [download the latest source code](../../archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Serena1432/Katheryne.git
```

* Change the current directory to the source folder:

```sh
cd Katheryne
```

* Install all the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

* Install all required applications listed in the **Required applications** section above, depends on your distro and your need.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

* Copy the `.env.sample` file to a new one and rename it to `.env`, then edit the file and specify the token with the `TOKEN` variable.

* Copy the `config.sample` folder into a new one, and rename it to `config`. After that, config the BOT yourself to your liking based on the instructions below.

You can view the example of all configurations in the `config.sample` folder.

### üîß Starting

#### Running Katheryne as normal user

```sh
npm start
```

#### Enable further debugging

You can enable further debugging logs that contain all of the command the BOT uses to run by running one of these commands below instead of `npm start`. Remember that further debugging can output some personal information, and you should be cautious when running it in public.

This is also required when reporting an issue related to the BOT.

For writing the logs directly to the console window, run this command:

```sh
npm run debug
```

For writing the logs to `journal` on Linux (useful for debugging serious crashes):

```sh
npm run debug_journal
```

#### Running Katheryne as root on Linux (not recommended)

```sh
sudo -E npm start
```

#### Autostart

You can of course use your Desktop Environment's Autostart settings (or Task Scheduler on Windows) to start Katheryne automatically after boot.

`pm2` is not recommended in my opinion due to it invoking the BOT before starting the DE, so it may cause some unwanted issues.

### üß© Special features

These are advanced features that require additional understanding and specific command arguments.

#### Assigning a different Steam account for each user

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must log in to all assigned Steam accounts **before** running the BOT. If an account isn't logged in, Steam will prompt for login when a user runs the `steam` command!
>
> Don't worry ‚Äî users won't be able to switch to any account other than the one assigned to them, as long as Steam is started using the specified command (`steam -user ${username}`). The BOT handles this automatically.

When a different Discord user runs the `steam` command, the BOT can launch Steam using a specific account assigned to that user. To enable this, you need to map each Discord user ID to a Steam account in the configuration.

For example, to assign the `nicolevianth` Steam account to user ID `693107293516070944` (this is my Discord ID!), edit your `config/main.json` file like this:

```json
{
    "language": "en",
    "owner_id": "693107293516070944",
    "prefix": "!",
    "whitelist": {
        "693107293516070944": "nicolevianth" // <---- This!
    }
}
```

Only users listed in the `whitelist` object can use the BOT. If you don‚Äôt want to assign a specific Steam account to a user, leave the value empty. The BOT will fall back to using the default Steam account defined in `config/steam.json`.

#### LocalStorage/Config data separation support

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the BOT separates data by Steam account username, **you must assign a Steam account to each Discord user** (even if they don‚Äôt use Steam directly).
>
> You need to specify the correct folder that switches the user account when its contents are different (that will require some research from yourself).

Some games store user data and settings in a shared folder within the game directory ‚Äî even if you use separate Wine prefixes, which can prevent user-specific login information from being properly applied.

To make switching between accounts seamless for users, the BOT allows you to isolate the `LocalStorage` or any config folder for each account.

- Define the target config folder using the `localStorage` property for each whitelisted app in `config/whitelisted_apps.json`. For example:

```json
{
    "process": "GenshinImpact.exe",
    "name": "Genshin Impact",
    "alias": "genshin",
    "command": {
        "default": "/home/murasame/StartGenshin.sh"
    },
    "screenshot": "/mnt/GenshinImpact/ScreenShot",
    "localStorage": "/mnt/GenshinImpact/GenshinImpact_Data/SDKCaches/HoYoPass", // <---- This!
    "channel": "1191968934635774034"
}
```

- When a user starts a game using the `steam` or `start` command, the BOT:
  1. Backs up the current contents of the specified folder to `database/${alias}_localStorage_.tar`.
  2. Extracts the user-specific `database/${alias}_localStorage_${steamUsername}.tar` file to that folder.

> [!NOTE]
> If the user has no previously backed-up data, the BOT will first copy the original folder. The user can then log in to their account and the game will modify the contents, which will subsequently be backed up separately as usual.

- When the session ends (via `exit`, `steam exit`, or `shutdown`), the BOT:
  1. Backs up the current folder contents to the user-specific `.tar` file.
  2. Restores the original data from `database/${alias}_localStorage_.tar`, returning the game to the computer owner‚Äôs default configuration.

#### Starting a session on behalf of another user

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available to BOT (computer) owners only.

Sometimes users may not know how to use the BOT, or you may want to launch a session for them manually.

- Copy the user's Discord ID, then run the `steam ${discordID}` or `start ${alias} ${discordID}` command with that copied Discord ID. For example:
  
```
!steam 693107293516070944

or

!start genshin 693107293516070944
```

- The BOT will reply with something like:
  
```
Starting with s1432_nbhz's specified information.
```

- The BOT will use the user's assigned Steam account and other relevant settings. That user will also be granted the permission to stop the session or shut down the system, as if they started the session themselves.

> [!TIP]
> You can also use `steam ${steamUsername}` or `start ${alias} ${steamUsername}` to start a session with a specific Steam account, even without a linked Discord account. However, only you (the owner) will be able to stop the session or shut down the computer in that case.

#### Permissive mode

Add the `-permissive` argument to the startup command to allow **all whitelisted users** to stop the session. This is useful when a session is shared among multiple users.

## üêû Known issues

I'm not a skilled Linux expert, so issues are unable to avoid. These are the known issues that I've experienced myself, and I'm not sure if these also work for you.

### Computer crashes after starting game while BOT is running

Try setting `high_temperature` in `config/logging.json` to `false` to disable high temperature warning. This logging may cause crashes on some devices and requires a force restart.

### Game crashes when locking/unlocking physical inputs on X11

The `xinput` commands used on X11 can be unstable on some devices, therefore it crashes the game when executing.

Try setting `evtest_on_x11` in `config/computer.json` to let the lock/unlock commands use `evtest` instead of `xinput`. It's more stable but it will require root permissions.

### Original LocalStorage/Config data won‚Äôt be restored if shutdown without using Katheryne

You just need to make the computer run `npm run shutdown_hook` before shutting down the computer. For example:

* Create a shell script running the shutdown hook first, for example `/usr/local/bin/katheryne-shutdown-hook.sh`:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
cd path/to/Katheryne
/usr/bin/npm run shutdown_hook
```

* Save it and make the `.sh` executable:

```sh
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/katheryne-shutdown-hook.sh
```

* Create a systemd service in `/etc/systemd/system`, for example `katheryne-shutdown-hook.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Katheryne shutdown hook
DefaultDependencies=no
Before=poweroff.target shutdown.target reboot.target halt.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/katheryne-shutdown-hook.sh
RemainAfterExit=true

[Install]
WantedBy=poweroff.target shutdown.target reboot.target halt.target
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the localStorage folder is in an external mounted drives, you have to include them in `katheryne-shutdown-hook.service`, for example:
>
> ```ini
> [Unit]
> Description=Katheryne shutdown hook
> DefaultDependencies=no
> Before=umount.target poweroff.target shutdown.target reboot.target halt.target
> RequiresMountsFor=/mnt/secondarydrive
> ```

* Save it, reload the daemon (or restart the computer) and enable the service:

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable katheryne-shutdown-hook.service
```

* You can test by restarting the computer and checking if it runs properly:

```sh
journalctl -b -1 -u katheryne-shutdown-hook.service
```
