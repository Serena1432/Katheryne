# Katheryne

**Katheryne** is a work-in-progress Discord BOT designed for remote gameplay, computer management, and connectivity via Discord.

Currently, it only supports Linux, with both X11 and Wayland compatibility. KDE Plasma is recommended since it's my development environment.

## Disclaimer

This BOT prioritizes simplicity and convenience over security and is intended for personal or small-scale use (e.g., providing a "cloud computer" for friends or remotely managing your own device). **It is not suitable for large public servers, as I cannot guarantee security at scale.**

Only grant permissions to trusted individuals. **USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK. I am not responsible for any damage resulting from its use.**

## Purpose

I originally created this BOT in 2023 to let my friends easily connect to my computer and use features remotely without relying on traditional remote control applications. It also allows me to manage my own computer while away.

The initial implementation worked well, but I lost the original code recently. To prevent this from happening again, I decided to rebuild it and make it open-source.

## Support

Katheryne works best with **KDE Plasma 6 on Linux** but is compatible with any distribution using X11 or Wayland.

Intel CPUs + NVIDIA GPUs are also recommended. I haven't tested AMD CPUs/GPUs, so be prepared for potential issues.

### Supported Remote Play Applications

‚úÖ Steam Link / Remote Play (official support)<br>
‚ö†Ô∏è Moonlight and other tools can be launched via remote execution but are **not officially supported**‚Äîyou have to run the commands manually.<br>
‚ùå Parsec is not supported (no Linux hosting support).

## Features

These features can be used directly in a Discord server, provided you have the required permissions:

- [X] Run whitelisted applications remotely using commands/built-in integrations
- [X] Take screenshots and monitor system stats
- [X] Auto-send in-game screenshots to a Discord channel
- [X] Lock the physical keyboard/mouse to prevent interference (I made that as my kids usually interrupt gameplay when my friends are playing)
- [X] Turn off the physical display and mute audio (for the same reason as above)
- [X] Send notifications (on-screen messages) to the computer from Discord
- [X] Refocus the game window if it minimizes unexpectedly
- [X] Remotely shut down the computer (only if the owner is away or explicitly allows it)
- [X] Remotely execute any commands on the computer (for BOT owner only)
- [X] Notify when the computer isn't plugged in, the battery is low, temperature is high or a driver error, requiring physical intervention
- [X] Check the connection between the user and computer through Steam Remote Play (experimental, may not work on some devices)

**Note:** Any changes with computer settings (physical input lock, brightness, volume, etc.) will be back to normal after restarting the computer. So if you encounter any errors when using the BOT, you just need to restart the computer.

Currently, AMD CPUs/GPUs are not properly supported as I don't have any AMD computers.

*To protect privacy, some features will only be available when a **whitelisted game/application is running**.*

### Running root commands

To run commands that require root permissions, you can do one of these ways below:

* Grant the permissions for specific commands used by the BOT (recommended)
* Running the BOT with `sudo` permissions
    * Using this way may cause some unexpected errors, proceed at your own risk.
    * Steam and some games will have some glitches, and tends to have a higher ping when Katheryne is running as root (idk why but it's what it is)
* Or don't use these commands at all

#### List of root commands

This is the list of commands requiring root permissions:

* **Intel GPU stats:**<br>`intel_gpu_top`
* **Set display brightness:**<br>`brightnessctl set ${pc}%`
* **Set CPU governor:**<br>`echo "${governor}" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor`
* **Set fan speed:**<br>`nbfc set -s ${pc}`
* **Physical input locking (Wayland):**<br>`evtest --grab /dev/input/event${id} >/dev/null`
* **Physical input device listing (Wayland):**<br>`libinput list-devices`

For security reasons, you have to find a way to allow these commands for your user by yourself.

## Required applications

### General

* `brightnessctl` (for brightness control)
* `scrot` (for X11 screenshot)
* `wmctrl` (for X11 window focusing)
* `nbfc-linux` (for fan control)
* `libinput-tools` (for input devices management)
* `evtest` (for Wayland physical input locking)
* `rfkill` (for enabling/disabling Bluetooth)

### Taking screenshots in Wayland

* `gnome-screenshot` (for GNOME-based desktop environments)
* `spectacle` (for KDE Plasma)
* `grim` (for other desktop environments)

### Intel GPUs

* `intel-gpu-tools`

### Starting

#### Running Katheryne as normal user

npm start

#### Running Katheryne as root (not recommended)

```
sudo -E npm start
```

### Autostart

You can of course use your Desktop Environment's Autostart settings (or `.config/autostart`) to start Katheryne automatically after boot.

`pm2` is not recommended in my opinion due to it invoking the BOT before starting the DE, so it may cause some unwanted issues.
