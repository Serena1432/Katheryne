# Katheryne

**Katheryne** is a work-in-progress Discord BOT designed for remote gameplay, computer management, and connectivity via Discord.

Currently, it only supports Linux, with BOTh X11 and Wayland compatibility. KDE Plasma is recommended since it's my development environment.

## Disclaimer

This BOT prioritizes simplicity and convenience over security and is intended for personal or small-scale use (e.g., providing a "cloud computer" for friends or remotely managing your own device). **It is not suitable for large public servers, as I cannot guarantee security at scale.**

Only grant permissions to trusted individuals. **USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK. I am not responsible for any damage resulting from its use.**

## Purpose

I originally created this BOT in 2023 to let my friends easily connect to my computer and use features remotely without relying on traditional remote control applications. It also allows me to manage my own computer while away.

The initial implementation worked well, but I lost the original code recently. To prevent this from happening again, I decided to rebuild it and make it open-source.

## Support

Katheryne works best with **KDE Plasma 6 on Linux** but is compatible with any distribution using X11 or Wayland.

Intel CPUs + NVIDIA GPUs are also recommended. I haven't tested AMD CPUs/GPUs, so be prepared for potential issues.

### Supported Remote Play Applications

✅ Steam Link / Remote Play (official support)
⚠️ Moonlight and other tools can be launched via remote execution but are **not officially supported**—you have to run the commands manually.
❌ Parsec is not supported (no Linux hosting support).

## Features

These features can be used directly in a Discord server, provided you have the required permissions:

- [ ] Run whitelisted applications remotely using commands/built-in integrations
- [ ] Take screenshots and monitor system stats
- [ ] Auto-send in-game screenshots to a Discord channel
- [ ] Lock the physical keyboard/mouse to prevent interference (I made that as my kids usually interrupt gameplay when my friends are playing)
- [ ] Turn off the physical display and mute audio (for the same reason as above)
- [ ] Send notifications to the computer (e.g., on-screen messages from Discord)
- [ ] Refocus the game window if it minimizes unexpectedly
- [ ] Remotely shut down the computer (only if the owner is away or explicitly allows it)
- [ ] Notify when the computer isn't plugged in, the battery is low or a driver error, requiring physical intervention

To protect privacy, some features will only be available when a **whitelisted game/application is running**.

Commands marked with (*) will require root permissions to execute. You can do one of these ways below:

* Running the BOT with `sudo` permissions
* Grant the permissions for specific commands used by the BOT
* Or don't use these commands at all

### Additional Features for BOT (Computer) Owners

- [ ] Execute any command on your computer remotely
  - [ ] Provide proper stdin/stdout passthrough for interactive commands
